# Automated Document Generation

Add the ability to generate personalized documents for students and activities. For example:
- Participation certificates (PDF or DOCX)
- Activity summary reports
- Downloadable sign-up confirmations

This would use a document template and fill in student/activity details automatically.

## Why?
This would help students and teachers easily get proof of participation and streamline reporting.
