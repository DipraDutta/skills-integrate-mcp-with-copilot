# Template-Based Communication

Implement customizable templates for communication:
- Email notifications for sign-up, reminders, or changes
- Certificate or report templates
- Customizable text for confirmations and alerts

## Why?
This would make communication more professional and allow teachers to tailor messages to their needs.
